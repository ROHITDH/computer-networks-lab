## NS TOOL PROGRAMS
1. Implement pt-to-pt network with 4 nodes and duples links bw them. Analyse the network performance by setting up queue size, and varying bandwidth

2. Simulate 4 node pt-to-pt network and connect link as follows:
    TCP - n0 to n3
    UDP - n1 to n3
   Find no. of packets sent by TCP and UDP
