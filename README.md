## NS TOOL PROGRAMS
1. Implement pt-to-pt network with 4 nodes and duples links bw them. Analyse the network performance by setting up queue size, and varying bandwidth
2. Simulate 4 node pt-to-pt network and connect link as follows:
    TCP - n0 to n3
    UDP - n1 to n3
   Find no. of packets sent by TCP and UDP
3. Implement Ethernet LAN using n(6-10) nodes. Compare the throughput by changing the error rate and data rate
4. Implement Ethernet LAN using "n" nodes & assign multiple traffic to the nodes and obtain congestion window for different sources and destination
5. Implementation of Link State Routing Algorithm to compute shortest path
