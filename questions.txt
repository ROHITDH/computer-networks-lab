1. Implement pt-to-pt network with 4 nodes and duples links bw them.
    Analyse the network performance by setting up queue size, and varying bandwidth

2. Simulate 4 node pt-to-pt network and connect link as follows:
    TCP - n0 to n3
    UDP - n1 to n3
   Find no. of packets sent by TCP and UDP

3. Implement Ethernet LAN using n(6-10) nodes. 
    Compare the throughput by changing the error rate and data rate

0 1 2 3
7 6 5 4

throughput = (packet/time)*(8/1024) 

---------------------------
 error rate  |   data rate      | Throughput
---------------------------
    0.1             0.001           324.249231 Mbps
    0.3             0.01            261.200769 Mbps
    0.5             0.1             174.133846 Mbps


4. Implement Ethernet LAN using "n" nodes & 
    assign multiple traffic to the nodes and obtain congestion window for different sources and destination

5. Implementation of Link State Routing Algorithm to compute shortest path
